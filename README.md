# CostumePacDeleter
Delete costume .pac files in brawl mods in order to drag and drop moveset files.

Does not delete the kirby folder for multiple reasons. If you have custom kirby costumes you're going to have to port them yourself.

Also does not delete spy or etc files. If you made custom etc files make sure that you don't overwrite them.
