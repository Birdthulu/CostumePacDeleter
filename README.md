# CostumePacDeleter
Delete costume .pac files in brawl mods in order to drag and drop moveset files.

Does not delete the kirby folder for multiple reasons. If you have custom kirby costumes you're going to have to port them yourself.

Also does not delete spy or etc files. If you made custom etc files make sure that you don't overwrite them.

# Usage:
Open the fighter folder of the build with the updated moveset files. For example "F:\Project+\pf\fighter\" Copy the path and paste it into the program. Wait until it finishes and type "exit" to close the program. Drag the fighter folder you used with the program into your custom build and hit replace. Your build should now have the updated movesets.
